This project exists to allow a Makefile to handle
the grunt work of assembly and disk compilation
while studying how to produce 4-voice music on
a TRS-80 Color Computer.

Most of the code was written by other people.

	Paul Fiscarelli
	Clell A. Dildy Jr.
	Larry Konecky
	Bob Ludlum
	Hal Chamberlain

My respect to all of them.
